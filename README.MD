Word2vec is a family of algorithms used to learn word vectors from large textual training data using co-occurrence statistics.

This is a Python re-implementation of the original [word2vec C code](https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec).

Please note that this project exists mainly for educational purposes, e.g. to help develop an understanding of the algorithms.

For a highly-optimized version of word2vec use the [Gensim implementation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html).

Training data can for example be downloaded from [http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip).

For a conda environment see `env.yaml`.
